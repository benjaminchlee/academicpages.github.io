I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en/" target="_blank">VISUS</a>, University of Stuttgart. I am part of the <a href="https://visvar.github.io/" target="_blank">VISVAR</a> group lead by Prof. Michael Sedlmair, and will be working with Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg when he <a href="https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en/news/news/Dieter-Schmalstieg-Receives-Alexander-von-Humboldt-Professorship-00002/" target="_blank">officially joins VISUS later in 2023</a>.

I received my PhD on <a href="https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Surfaces_and_Spaces_in_Immersive_Analytics/22654564" target="_blank">Surfaces and Spaces in Immersive Analytics</a> at the <a href="https://www.monash.edu/it/hcc/dvia-lab" target="_blank">Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics Lab</a>, Monash University. My supervisors were Prof. Tim Dwyer (main), A/Prof. Bernhard Jenny, Dr. Maxime Cordeil, and Dr. Arnaud Prouzeau.

My research revolves around the field of Immersive Analytics: the use of virtual and/or augmented reality technologies to support visual data exploration and presentation. At present, my main research topic is on situated visualisation. My work has also investigated how 2D surfaces can be used inside of an immersive 3D space to facilitate (collaborative) visual analysis and data understanding.

I currently have the pleasure of co-supervising two PhD students: <a href="https://visvar.github.io/members/nina_doerr.html" target="_blank">Nina DÃ¶rr</a> (attention guidance in VR/AR) and <a href="https://visvar.github.io/members/xingyao_yu.html" target="_blank">Xingyao Yu</a> (motion guidance in VR).

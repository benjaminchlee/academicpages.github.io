I'm a PhD student at the Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics Lab, part of Monash Universityâ€™s Faculty of IT in Melbourne, Australia. My supervisors are <a href="https://ialab.it.monash.edu/~dwyer/" target="_blank">Prof. Tim Dwyer</a> (main), <a href="https://berniejenny.info/" target="_blank">A/Prof. Bernhard Jenny</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cordeil/home/" target="_blank">Dr. Maxime Cordeil</a> and <a href="http://www.aprouzeau.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Arnaud Prouzeau</a>.

My current research interests revolve around immersive analytics, which explores how virtual and augmented reality technologies can be used to both support users in their data analysis tasks, and to faciliate better understanding of data. So far, I have investigated how multiple users collaboratively analyse multivariate data and find insights together, and explored novel ways to provide a more intuitive understanding of data to people using virtual reality. I am now currently exploring how data visualisations can intuitively be transformed between conventional 2D and novel 3D representations in augmented reality to enhance data exploration.

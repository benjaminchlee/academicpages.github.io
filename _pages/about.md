My research revolves around the field of Immersive Analytics: the use of virtual and/or augmented reality technologies to support visual data exploration and presentation. In particular, my work has investigated how 2D surfaces can be used inside of an immersive 3D space to facilitate (collaborative) visual analysis and data understanding.

I will be starting a postdoctoral position at <a href="https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en/" target="_blank">VISUS</a>, University of Stuttgart with Prof. Michael Sedlmair and Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg in February 2023.

I submitted my PhD at the <a href="https://www.monash.edu/it/hcc/dvia-lab" target="_blank">Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics Lab</a>, Monash University. My supervisors were Prof. Tim Dwyer (main), A/Prof. Bernhard Jenny, Dr. Maxime Cordeil, and Dr. Arnaud Prouzeau.

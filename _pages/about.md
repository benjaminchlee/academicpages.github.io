I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en/" target="_blank">VISUS</a>, University of Stuttgart. I currently work with Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg and Prof. Michael Sedlmair.

I received my PhD on at the Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics Lab (now Embodied Visualisation Lab), Monash University in 2023. My advisors were Prof. Tim Dwyer (main), A/Prof. Bernhard Jenny, Dr. Maxime Cordeil, and Dr. Arnaud Prouzeau.

My research revolves around the field of Immersive Analytics: the use of virtual and/or augmented reality technologies to support visual data exploration and presentation. My main research interests revolve around the topics of situated visualisation, hybrid user interfaces, and data-driven storytelling—all facilitated through the use of immersive display technologies.

I currently have the pleasure of co-supervising three PhD students: <a href="https://visvar.github.io/members/nina_doerr.html" target="_blank">Nina Dörr</a> (attention guidance in VR/AR), <a href="https://visvar.github.io/members/xingyao_yu.html" target="_blank">Xingyao Yu</a> (motion guidance in VR), and <a href="https://visvar.github.io/members/carlos-victor_quijano-chavez.html" target="_blank">Carlos-Victor Quijano-Chavez</a> (situated visualisation and analytics).
